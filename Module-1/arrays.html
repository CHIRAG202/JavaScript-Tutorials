# An array is a data structure used to store multiple values in a single variable. In some programming languages, 
arrays can only hold values of the same type, but not in JavaScript. In JavaScript, you can have values of different types in 
the same array.

`var car = new Array("BMW", "Saab", "Maserati");`

`The first item in the list referred to as being in position zero, and counting up from there.

car[0] = "BMW";
car[1] = "Saab";
car[2] = "Maserati"; `
