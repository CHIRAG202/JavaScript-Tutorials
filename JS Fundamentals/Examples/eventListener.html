<!--We're now using the keyup event. This event happens whenever you release a key after pressing it. As you may guess, there is a keydown event too that is fired whenver you press a key. We're using keyup because keydown happens before a key actually registers which means we would always be one key behind.
We're reference input.value. The value property of an input reflects whatever the user has typed into the input.
We're taking whatever is in input.value and passing that directly into the paragraph.innerText. Since that function is called every time a user types into the input, it keeps the two in sync -->
